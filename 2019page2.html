									<h1>Sustainibility<br />
									Project</h1>
									<p>This project focuses on sustainibility and humanitarian engineering. The task
										is set in timor leste, a developing country which does not have modern day

									Above is a power point presentation, which was presented as a proposal of what we will be building, why and how.
									We provided a few solution options in which alterna as portrayed by the report. Was the best option.
									<br />
									<br />
									Something that was quite challenging with this assignment. Was working as a group with new people in a new environment.
									This was one of the first university projects I had undertaken and it really allowed me to fully understand how group
									projects work and run. Additionaly, another challenge faced with thi project was designing solutions for third world countries.
									There are a lot of things on the table that need to be considered. Such as cost, materials, labour and transportation
									of the materials. It really makes you think outside the box and apply all tyes of engineering strategies as a team
									to develop an optimal solution.
