									<h1>Systems<br />
									Programming</h1>
									<p>This project focuses on advanced C programming. Focusing on systems programming ,sockets, pointers, multithreading...</p>

									The developement of this project proved to be a great challenge. Advnaced topics such as multi threading, mutexes
									and signals were all new topics that seem daunting at first. But if tackled one step at a time allow for an
									efficient and quick program without blocking.
									<br />
									<br />
									The way this program works. Is when connected to the same ip address and port such as (localhost) and (port_number).
									Through socket programming the controller is able to comminucate to the overseer. Acting as a client and server respectively.
									The server is designed to operate as a multithreaded server with 5 threads. This means the conrroller can send up to
									5 differnt tasks and it will complete them simultaneously. However is more than that are sent they are addded to a queue.
									Since multithreading in this case is done via thread pools when a thread is free it goes to the next item in the queue
									till all taks are complete. If the overseer is given no taks it keeps listening untill it is terminated or till it gets
									a task then reverts back to listening once the task it complete. Additionally, for ease of compilation a make file is
									provided.
									<br />
									<br />
									Development of this project was entirely done in Ubuntu. It only works in Ubuntu or most linx based operating systems.
									This was an exciting challenge for me as it was my first steps into the world of linux and developement in its environment.
									To run linux I had to run it virtually. Something id reccomend if you would like to attempt a similar project, or develop
									in linux on a different host operating system such as macos or windows.
